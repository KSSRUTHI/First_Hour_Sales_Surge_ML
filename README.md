#  Sales Surge Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to predict **first-hour sales surges** for products listed on e-commerce platforms using structured product metadata scraped from the web.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `sales_surge_prediction_pipeline.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with full implementation from preprocessing to evaluation.
- `strategically_balanced_dataset.xlsx`: Cleaned and engineered dataset with 5,000 product entries.

---

##  Objective

To predict whether a newly listed product will experience a **sales surge** in the first hour of launch based on key features such as pricing, brand, visibility, and user engagement signals (e.g., reviews, Prime tag, Amazon's Choice).

---

##  Dataset Overview

- Total Records: 5,000
- Target Variable: `surge` (1 = surge in first-hour sales, 0 = no surge)
- Key Features:
  - `price`, `rating`, `reviews`
  - `is_prime`, `is_amazon_choice`
  - `cart_adds`, `velocity_score`
  - `age_tier`, `brand`, `category`, `price_category`

---

##  Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Missing Values:** Imputed using median (for `cart_adds`) and mode (for `price_category`)
- **Noise Injection:** Gaussian noise added to `price` (Ïƒ=2) and `rating` (Ïƒ=0.1)
- **Label Noise Simulation:** 2% of surge labels were flipped to mimic real-world uncertainty
- **Encoding:** Label Encoding used for categorical features
- **Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE applied to balance classes
- **Normalization:** z-score normalization used for models sensitive to scaling

## Visualizations

-  **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows feature relationships with `surge`
-  **Top Feature Importance (Random Forest):** `reviews`, `hourly_sales`, and `price` among top predictors

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Excel, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
